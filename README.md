# Features
Browser fingerprinting is the technique of creating a distinct identifier by gathering and documenting an array of factors encompassing the browser, operating system, and hardware settings. This unique digital signature is derived from a meticulous analysis of various browser attributes, including the user agent, language, screen dimensions, plugin versions, fonts, time settings, and more. Since each individual's browser setup is unique, browser fingerprints have the potential to be employed for monitoring online behavior, recognizing user identities, and even, regrettably, for illicit activities such as fraudulent schemes and phishing attempts.

### âš¡ Lightning Fast Profile Creation
Just four steps to open a fingerprint browser.
- download the source code
- download the main program main.exe to ```./resources/browermain```
- run ```npm isntall``` 
- run ```npm run dev```

### ðŸ“Š Fingerprint option

- Operating System: Modify the operating system part in `userAgent`.
- Browser version: Modify the browser version in `userAgent`.
- Proxy settings: Modify the browser proxy which supports "Default", "Do not use proxy", "Custom".
- User Agent: Modify `userAgent`.
- Language: Modify `navigator.language`, `navigator.languages`, and it can be automatically matched based on IP.
- Time zone: Modify the time zone in `new Date()`, and it can be automatically matched based on IP.
- WebRTC
- Geolocation: Modify the latitude and longitude in `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()`, and it can be automatically matched based on IP.
- Resolution: Modify `screen.width`/`screen.height`.
- Font: Randomly modify the supported font list.
- Canvas: Randomly modify Canvas 2D drawing differential pixels.
- WebGL image: Randomly modify WebGL drawing differential pixels.
- WebGL metadata: WebGL vendor, WebGL rendering, etc.
- AudioContext: Randomly modify the differential data of `getChannelData` and `getFloatFrequencyData` in AudioContext.
- ClientRects
- Device name
- Do Not Track
- SSL
- Port scan protection
- Hardware acceleration
